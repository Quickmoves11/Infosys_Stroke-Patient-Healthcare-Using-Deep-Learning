# Infosys_Stroke-Patient-Healthcare-Using-Deep-Learning

**<ins>Dataset Description:</ins>**       
This dataset contains critical information such as medical history, lifestyle choices, and health metrics. It includes features like gender, age, hypertension status, heart disease status, marital status, work type, residence type, average glucose level, body mass index (BMI), and smoking status. The dataset serves as a valuable resource for understanding the relationships between these variables and stroke incidence, facilitating research and predictive modeling in healthcare.

**<ins>Dataset:</ins>**  
The dataset provided consists of patient records aimed at analyzing stroke occurrences and related factors:
* **id:** Unique identifier for each patient
* **gender:** Gender of the patient (Male/Female)
* **age:** Age of the patient
* **hypertension:** Hypertension status (0: No, 1: Yes)
* **heart_disease:** Heart disease status (0: No, 1: Yes)
* **ever_married:** Marital status (Yes/No)
* **work_type:** Type of work (e.g., Private, Self-employed)
* **Residence_type:** Type of residence (Urban/Rural)
* **avg_glucose_level:** Average glucose level in the patient's blood
* **bmi:** Body Mass Index of the patient
* **smoking_status:** Smoking status (e.g., formerly smoked, never smoked)
* **stroke:** Stroke occurrence status (1: Yes, 0: No)

# **(1) Defining Problem Statement and Analyzing Basic Information**
***

In this section, we will define the problem statement and analyze the basic metrics of the healthcare stroke dataset to understand its structure and characteristics:

1. **Shape of the Dataset:** 
   - Provides the number of rows and columns, giving insight into the dataset's size.

2. **Data Information:**
   - Using the `info()` function to display data types and the count of non-null entries, which helps identify potential issues with missing values and data types.

3. **Describe:**
   - Utilizing the `describe()` function to summarize numerical features of the dataset, providing insights into central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the datasetâ€™s distribution.
